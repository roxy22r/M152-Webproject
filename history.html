            <h1 id="chapter1">The Boxing History</h1>
            <p>

                Boxing was among the most popular sports practiced in ancient Greece and was one of the former
                disciplines inside the Olympic Games. Romans adopted this sport as they did with almost all the Greek
                culture, but in Rome, the contenders wore metal protectors for fighting in order to protect their hands.
                Such protectors were called "cestus" and they had nail in the exterior so more than once the rival was
                killed during a boxing match.

            </p>

            <p>
                Although boxing and fighting have been always confused as exchangeable terms they are different sports
                since what it was generically called fighting more often refers to wrestling. However, boxing is as
                older as over 4,000 years BC. The first boxing records come from Egypt and East before it became a
                classic sport in Greece. In modern times, boxing appears in the records after the Duke of Alberman
                organized in England a fight between his butler and the butcher around 1681.


            </p>
            <p>

                From then onwards, boxing only appears, as we know it today until the 18th century when it was practiced
                for money, but the boxing gloves were not part of the equipment of a boxer yet. However, it is known
                that the money involved in those matches came from the spectators making bets on the contenders.
            </p>

            <p>


                In 1719 boxing had its first heavyweight champion, the English James Figg, and another champion John
                Broughton formulated the first boxing regulations in 1743, regulations that were modified and changed
                for about a whole century.
            </p>
            <p>

                In 1865, the Marquess of Queensberry implemented the regulations that remain until today that require
                wearing gloves, hence the last bare fits heavyweight champion was John L. Sullivan who fought against
                Jake Kilrain in 1889. Even thought, he lost the championship in New Orleans, Louisiana on September 7,
                1892 when he was defeated by James Corbett in a fight in which he had to wear gloves.
            </p>
            <p>

                The first lighter-weight world champion recognized was the English boxer Billy Edwards who won the title
                fighting against the U.S. boxer Tom Collins, in a historic fight that began on May 24, 1871 and ended on
                December 6 of that same year. The day of the fighting the police appeared on the scene and the boxers
                were arrested, but resumed the match two days later after paying S1000, but later they were taken to
                prison and only after appealing to the court they regained their freedom and the right to conclude the
                match that year.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the turn of the century, boxing became popular worldwide and the first remarkable fighting of 1900
                took place in Coney Island with a match between Jeffries versus Corbett. In 1908, Jack Johnson defeated
                Tommy Burns in Sidney, Australia, and became their first black boxer to win a heavyweight title in the
                boxing story.

            <h1 id="chapter2">Five Hardest Hitters in Boxing History</h1>
            <p>

                The best thing about heavyweights is the chance of a spectacular ending. The fighting machine could end
                the
                fight with one blow making it more exciting than ever. Here's a look of the top hardest hitters in
                boxing
                history that gave us a sudden but out of this world moment:
            <h2>Mike Tyson</h2> <br>
            </p>
            <p>

                Tyson was lethal when he combined his speed with his power. He is at his best within the first six
                rounds
                and is not the same after. He intimidated opponents with his fearsome reputation. He is known for his
                early
                knock-outs at 30 and 91 seconds. He was destructive at his prime, going in the ring like he was going on
                a
                battle, with all his pent-up energy and determination; he was a force to be reckoned with - earning him
                a
                spot at the top of the hardest hitters in boxing history.
            </p>

            <h1>Sonny Liston</h1>
            <p>

                Some people think that his chance to fight for the title was a long time coming. He was at his prime
                even
                before that, delivering fire power and early knock-outs. But people tend to remember Liston as the
                dismal
                opponent of Muhammad Ali. His uncompromising and menacing demeanor made Liston the opponent to beat. He
                was
                perhaps the most underrated hardest hitter in the boxing history.
            </p>
            <h2>Joe Louis</h2>
            <p>

                Also known as the Brown Bomber, Louis was formidable at his prime. He was not like the others who finish
                their opponents with one punch. He was what the boxing insiders called the great finisher; because once
                he
                gets hold of his opponent, he never let go. He also intimidates his opponents with his fearless aura and
                his
                opponents were ready to be knocked-down even before the fight, truly one of the hardest hitters in
                boxing
                history.
            </p>

            <h2>George Foreman</h2>
            <p>

                Also known as Big George in the boxing circuit, he did not pack a punch gracefully. He was clubbing left
                and
                right his opponents; delivery big, looping, forceful and bludgeoning blows. His massive punch gave him
                the
                spot to the hardest hitters in boxing history; once his opponents walk into this unstoppable force, it's
                the
                point of no return.
            </p>
            <h2>Rocky Marciano</h2>
            <p>
                Forty-nine successive wins and 43 knocked-outs earned him the right to be one of the hardest hitter in
                boxing history. He is known to take his time, softening up his opponents with bruising bombardment. His
                right hand is said to change day to night; ending the fight for his opponents. He shows great
                single-shot
                punch delivered late into the fight ending his opponent with his blockbuster right hand.
