                <h1>Boxing Equipment - Some Random Facts</h1>
                <p>
                Boxing, as you may surmise, can be risky, if it is not refereed or conducted carefully. Hence, it requires several items that protect the different parts of your body. These items are often a one-time investment; and therefore a boxer doesn't look at buying cheap items again and again. The first time he invests, therefore, he makes certain he buys strong and durable items that will efficiently serve their purpose for many years to come.
<br>
Let's look in detail at these two categories of boxing equipment items: training and protecting. Here are a few details on each.
<br><br>
1. Training equipment
<br><br>
• Punch bag
If punch bags of a few years ago created so many bruises on the boxer's knuckles, those of today are a quite different story. They are made of quality materials that provide a safe striking surface and are filled with materials that give flexibility and toughness to the bag simultaneously. The punch bag gives the boxer an excellent surface to practice his knockout punches.
<br><br>
• Speed bag
A speed bag provides the boxer with much needed hand-eye coordination as its movements cannot be predicted. Speed bags keep him focused throughout his training.
